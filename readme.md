# Writing a compiler

Let's say we want to write a single language. What shall it support?

* Expressions
* Variables
* One loop expression, with continue and break
* If / Else
* Functions
* Classes
* Modules
* Patterns? (observer, strategy, co-routines etc)
* Memory management / Garbage Collection?
* Exceptions?

How can we get out of the Von Neuman architecture,
with variables for storage, 
control statements for jump and test instructions,
and assignments for fetching, doing math and storing?

How can we avoid the imperative language, but go to 
declarative mathematical language?

## Phases

1. parser. read the file(s) and parse all the items
2. ast. by going over the tokens, you build the abstract syntax tree, 
a data oriented representation of the code
3. generate. targeting a specific CPU, you emit either assembly
or machine code for it

We'll need some good data structures (dictionaries, list, trees) for this.

## Giants

Of course I'm relying on giants here, I'm here to discover and learn.

## Examples

Output from reading the file phase:

```
Read 660 bytes from file sample.c
---------------------
/*
    This is a sample comment.
    It exceeds in many lines.
    Thank you.
*/

int simple_var;
int var_with_value;

// this is a comment
int add_numbers(int a, int b) {
    int c = 2 * 3 + 4; // 10
    int d = 2 + 3 * 4; // 14
    int e = (2 + 3) * 4;    // 5 * 4
    int f = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4;  // 10
    int f = 1 * 2 + 3 * 4;  // 2 + 12
    int f = 1 + 2 * 3 + 4;  // 1 + 6 + 4

    if (c > 3) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return c;
    }

    int x = 3;
    while (x > 0) {
        // something
        if (x > 10)
            continue;
        if (x < 3)
            break;
    }
}

// this is another comment
void main() {
    // func1(5);
}
```

## What did I learn?

That compilers are indeed interesting beasts!

The first phase is loading and parsing the file. We get rid of newlines,
empty space (where it can be ignored, as opposed say to Python), etc.
We end up with a stream of tokens, e.g. symbols, names, numbers etc.

The second phase is to parse these tokens into an AST, or *Abstract Syntax Tree*.
That means that the logic of the code is represented as data. 

For example, an `if` statement is represented as a node with three children,
one for the condition expression, one for the body if the condition evaluates
as true, and a final one for the body if the condition evaluates as false.
The expression can be a simple or nested expression to great depths,
while the bodies are sequences of statements, exactly like the `if` we are looking at.

The main parser I used for parsing the tokens is a *Recursive Descending parser*, 
which identifies parts of the program and calls the appropriate piece of code
to consume the tokens and generate the AST nodes. For expressions, since precedence
comes into play (e.g. multiplications must be done before additions, even if they 
appear to the right of the additions), I used a *Shunting Yard* algorithm, which 
uses stacks to make the highest priority operations pop last.
